SDK
===

Our SDK are here to help you call Angus.ai http API easily, without drafting the appropriate HTTP request yourself.
Installing and configuring one of our SDKs is needed to run:

- the audience analytics client applications shown here (:ref:`apps`)
- and/or the building blocks code samples documented here (:ref:`buidling-blocks`)

If the SDK in the language of your choice is not provided here, you can:

- contact us at support@angus.ai.
- or use our http API directly by referring to our full API reference (:ref:`http-api`)

Pick the SDK of your choice (in case of doubt, use Python as it is a but easier to setup).

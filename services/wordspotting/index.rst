These services spots specified words (or group of words) in a complex speech input.

Angus.ai currently features 2 different versions of the service:

* ``version 2``:
 * works with any speaker (speaker independent),
 * no training required,
 * works on 6 different languages.

* ``version 1``:
 * only works with speakers the service has been trained for,
 * available in all languages.

If you don't know which to pick,
start with ``version 2`` as it is easier get started (no training required).

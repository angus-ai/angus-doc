After creating your personal account on https://console.angus.ai/, you will be asked to create a “stream”. This procedure will allow for a private “access_token” and “client_id” keys to be generated for you. This can be done by pressing the “Add a stream” button on the top right hand corner as shown below.

After clicking, you will be asked to choose between a free developer stream and a paying enterprise stream. Please note that the free developer stream is only for non commercial use and will block after 3 hours of video stream computed every month as seen below.

For an non restricted enterprise stream, you will need to enter a valid credit card number.

Press “Continue” at the bottom of the page and you will soon get the following page. Press “Show Details” and take note of your “client_id” and “access_token” keys as they will be needed later on.
